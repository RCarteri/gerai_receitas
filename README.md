This project was created to solve a problem I faced when I started living alone... Cooking. I had no idea how to even cook rice. Living alone and facing an empty kitchen and a fridge full of unknown ingredients ‚Äì who hasn't felt that pang of anxiety, the insecurity of not knowing where to start?

The app suggests easy and personalized recipes generated by Google's artificial intelligence, guiding you step by step in preparing delicious meals.
